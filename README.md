MacShell
========

Web Application Shell for Mac OS X.

MacShell uses the new WKWebView that shipped with OS XYosemite (10.10).

The API provides access to many functionalities typical for native OS X applications like badges in the dock, tray icons or Menu bars.

MacShell is written in Swift, so it should be easy for web developers to understand most parts of the code as Swift is (unlike Objective-C) very similar to JavaScript.
